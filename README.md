# AngularJwtAuth / Authentification / Autorisation 

The goal was to learn how deploy a mini-project springboot/angular SignUp SignIn Auth/auto  on Heroku.

Somes obstacles are been managed :
- proxying to the backend
- JWT expired durin run springboot
- script node server.js during prod Heroku

But I have to search why pages admin and user are not available after logging.
(maybe is linked to the ResponseEntity of request GET(signin)) 

This project generated is deployed on Cloud Heroku

## Backend server
SPRINGBOOT 2 + SPRING JPA + SPRING SECURITY + JWT ARCHITECTURE
