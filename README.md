# AngularJwtAuth / Authentification / Autorisation 

The goal was to learn how deploy a mini-project springboot/angular SignUp SignIn Auth/auto  on Heroku.

Somes obstacles are been worked out and managed :
- proxying to the backend
- JWT expired durin run springboot
- script node server.js during prod Heroku

I have to pass more time to get page admin and user and maybe the problem is linked to the ResponseEntity of request GET(signin) 

This project generated is deployed on Cloud Heroku
